# Nonlinear Regression Model Comparison in R

## Overview
This project compares the performance of several nonlinear and linear regression models using the `caret` package in R. The models are trained and evaluated on a chemical manufacturing dataset, as well as a simulated dataset from `mlbench.friedman1()`. The goal is to identify the most accurate model and understand the influence of hyperparameters and feature importance.

| MARS                      | Degree = 2, Terms = 8          | 1.1637   |
| Lasso (Linear)            | Lambda = 0.0621                | **1.1449** |
| Partial Least Squares     | Components = 3                 | 1.2224   |
| K Nearest Neighbors       | Neighbors = 11                 | 1.4634   |
| Multiple Linear Regression| N/A                            | 3.2825   |

## ðŸ’¡ Insights
- **SVM** had the best performance among nonlinear models.
- **Lasso** was the top-performing linear model, very close to SVM.
- **MARS** performed competitively and correctly identified the informative predictors (X1â€“X5).
- Predictor importance analysis shows **process variables dominate** over biological ones.
